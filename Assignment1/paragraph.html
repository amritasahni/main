<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing <br>and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's <br>standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown <br>printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make <br>a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, <br>but also the leap into electronic typesetting,<br> remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the <br>1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem <br>Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing<br> software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
